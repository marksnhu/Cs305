Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  Our client artemis financial was a finance company that deals with different types of accounts for a large amount of customers. These accounts include savings,retirements, investments and insurance. They wanted us to Ensure that all the sensitive information being handled by their company is kept secure and encryped all the while following local laws.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
  As a product developer for this problem i ensured that all of the clients needs were kept organized in a way that we would tick every box they gave us in regards to what they were expecting. We also did some research to ensure we were using the best type of encryption for the scenario. Code needs to be done securely because any vulnerabilities from code will stem out to severe penalities later on if any are found. Software security companies overall add a level of comfort to all of these huge institutions because of the fact that we are able to keep information private. Why would I as a customer trust someone with all the money I owe or all the information about me if i thought it could get taken easily?

  What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  The vulnerability assesment was very helpful to me because it taught me what common weak points are in a system that we might not take into consideration as a macro outlook on security fields.

  How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  I would use tools like maven and other vulnerability testers to ensure Im not doing anything in a weak way.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  Some manual review and static testing ensures that after we fixed certain vulnerabilities the threats were mostly eliminated.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  Theres a ton of online resources from other programmers that may have experienced the same or similar scenario as you. Things like stack overflow and other like websites are a great tool when your are stuck.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
  The main thing to show employers is your thouroughness and attention to detail. I would make sure to show them how attentative I was to the clients needs and how thorough I was upon completion.
